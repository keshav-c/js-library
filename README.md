A JavaScript App to keep track of books in a Library. It keeps track of information relevant to each book, like _title_, _author_, _number of pages_ and whether you have _read_ the book or not. Books can be added or removed from the library.

Once the book has been added to the list you can change it's status from _Already Read_ ![read icon](/images/read.png) to _Yet to Read_ ![unread icon](/images/unread.png), by clicking on the icon to toggle the `read` status.
